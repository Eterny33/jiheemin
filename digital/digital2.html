            <h7>Artist Statement</h7>
            <p>A few years ago, I was in a rural part of Quebec where I had a magical encounter with a flock of migratory birds flew above me, so low to the ground that I noticed their flapping sound. It was massive yet clear enough to distinguish individual movements, vigorous yet soft. Looking to recreate this surreal experience, I have started a long-term project researching various ways of mimicking the flapping, with objects that show traces of my body parts.</p>
  <p><i><b>A Few Flaps to Belong</b></i> is a series of works that makes a parallel between human’s obsessive longing for flight and one’s desire to cope with a foreign land. Mimicking wings, the works in the series evoke a romantic notion of flying in relation to my yearning for home and desire to belong. With the use of cyanotype, which is an outdated camera-less photographic technic, I bring nostalgia to talk about my ongoing struggle for grounding Korean Diaspora within Canadian identity.</p>

            <h7>Bio</h7>
            <p>
Toronto-based artist, <b>Jihee Min</b> employs narrative strategies and autobiographical experiences focusing on stereotypical issues of culture, language, memory and geography. Based on her personal experiences of Korean Diaspora in both Quebecois and English-Canadian environments, Min explores art as means to engage problems of identity and displaced culture within Canada’s multiculturalism. Her practice uses a wide range of media, such as sculpture, installation, performance, photography and drawing. </p>
<p>
Min holds MFA from Concordia University (Studio Arts) and BFA with Honours from OCAD University (Sculpture & Installation). She received various grants from Canada Council for the Arts, Ontario Arts Council, and Toronto Arts Council, as well as, numerous awards and scholarships including the Concordia MFA Studio Arts Award from Concordia University; the Sir Edmund Walker Scholarship and the Carmen Lamanna Scholarship from OCAD University. She has exhibited nationally across Canada and internationally, in the USA, Italy, Finland and Korea. Her work is part of various private and public collections including CAMH, the city of Toronto (ON), la ville de St-Bruno (QC), and Rauma (Finland).
