            <p>"<b><i>forward motion</i></b> brings together artworks that converge on concepts of mobility and movement, of transit and the transitory. Exploring ideas ranging from flight, time travel and immigration to displacement and circulation, each of the artists featured within the exhibition navigates the physical and conceptual dimensions of movement across time and space. What emerges through these multiple pathways are deeply felt responses to how the movement of bodies, objects and ideas influences the ways in which the artists featured here conceive of place-making, of awayness and hereness."
            <p>My recent work, <i><b>Tracing the Desire</b></i>, re-created site-specificf for this exhibition, and past work <i><b>Takeoff</b></i> are in this group exhibition. Feel free to pass by!

            <p>My attempts to capture traces of body movements on paper will be expressed through various use of cyanotype on paper and sculptures. The work intends to make a parallel between human’ body parts and birds’ wings, evoking romantic notion of flying in relation to time and memory.
